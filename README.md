## Lab 32

### Featured Tasks

Backend
Add a replica of your Exercise model to the backend Spring app. Create a POST route that allows creating a new Exercise,
and a GET route that responds with all Exercises currently in the database. Test these routes with Postman, deploy, and 
ensure there’s at least one Exercise in your deployed db. (This is all easy now… right?)

For testing purposes, ensure that you can visit the GET route and see JSON data for all Exercise entries.

Android: Post Exercises to the server
When a user creates a new Exercise locally on their device, in addition to saving it to the local database, the app 
should POST it to the server.
